\section*{Quadratic Equations}
\item Find the value of $p$, for which one root of the equation 
\begin{align*}
	px^2-14x+8=0
\end{align*}
is $6$ times the other.
\item If the roots of the equation
\begin{align*}
	\brak{c^2-ab}x^2-2\brak{a^2-bc}x+b^2-ac=0 
\end{align*}
in x are equal, then show that either a=0 or 
\begin{align*}
	a^3+b^3+c^3=3abc.
\end{align*}
\item Solve for x:
\begin{align*}
\dfrac{1}{2x-3}+\dfrac{1}{x-5}=1\dfrac{1}{9}, x\neq\dfrac{3}{2},5 
\end{align*}

\section*{Arithmetic Progressions}
\item What is the common difference of an A.P. in which $a_{21}$ - $a_7$ = $84$ ?
\item Which term of the A.P.$8,14,20,26,$\ldots will be $72$ more than its $41^{st}$ term ?
